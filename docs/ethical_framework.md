# The Sovereign OSINT Toolkit Manifesto
## Ethical OSINT in a Colonial Data Economy
### By Sarah Marion

## Preamble: The Colonial Algorithm

Most OSINT tools are digital extensions of colonial resource extraction. They harvest Global South data with Western epistemological frameworks that inevitably distort, decontextualize, and dispossess.

## Article 1: Sovereignty as Default

Kenyan data exists within Kenyan jurisdiction. This is non-negotiable. Our tools:
- Default to Kenyan data protection standards
- Require local stakeholder consultation
- Reject external jurisdiction claims over Kenyan digital assets

## Article 2: Guardianship, Not Ownership

We are temporary stewards, not permanent owners. This means:
- Data has expiration dates aligned with Kenyan retention laws
- Local institutions inherit our data collections
- We build capacity, not dependency

## Article 3: Reciprocity as Validation

No knowledge extraction without tangible return. Every operation must demonstrate:
- Capacity transfer to Kenyan analysts
- Resource flow to local communities
- Access provision for Kenyan institutions

## Implementation Protocol

### For Journalists:
- Public interest must be demonstrable
- Community voices must be centered
- Kenyan media ethics supersede international standards

### For Researchers:
- Kenyan co-investigators required for sensitive topics
- Local IRB approval mandatory
- Findings must be accessible in Kenya first

### For Developers:
- Open source with Kenyan developer access
- Documentation in accessible formats
- Training programs for local tech communities
