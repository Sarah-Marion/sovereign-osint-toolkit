# Sovereign Framework Implementation Guide
## For Kenyan OSINT Operations
### By Sarah Marion

## Philosophical Foundation

The Sovereign Framework emerges from recognizing that most OSINT tools are designed with Western epistemological frameworks that treat Kenyan data as extractive resources. This framework offers an alternative.

### Sovereignty in Practice

**Data Jurisdiction**: All collected data remains subject to Kenyan laws, particularly the Data Protection Act, 2019. 

**Local Control**: Kenyan stakeholders must approve significant data usage decisions. We reject the "helicopter research" model where foreign researchers extract data without local partnership.

**Example**: When collecting public procurement data, we ensure the Office of the Auditor General has oversight access.

### Guardianship Principles

**Stewardship Mindset**: We are temporary custodians of data, not owners. This means:
- Implementing data expiration policies
- Ensuring Kenyan institutions can take over data management
- Building local technical capacity

**Security Standards**: Data protection must meet or exceed Kenyan legal requirements, not just Western standards.

### Reciprocity Framework

**Benefit Flow**: Research must provide tangible benefits to Kenyan communities. This includes:
- Capacity building for local analysts
- Open access to findings for Kenyan institutions
- Revenue sharing for commercial applications

**Knowledge Transfer**: Every project must include a knowledge transfer component to Kenyan partners.
