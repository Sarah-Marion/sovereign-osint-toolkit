# SGR-OSINT: Decolonial Intelligence Framework
## By Sarah Marion

> "When algorithms become colonial instruments, we build tools of digital sovereignty.

### The Colonial Algorithm Problem

Most OSINT tools emerge from Western security paradigms that treat Global South data as extractive resources. This framework challenges that paradigm through the SGR Protocol: **Sovereignty, Guardianship, Reciprocity**.

### Kenyan-Focused Intelligence

Unlike generic OSINT tools, SGR-OSINT understands that:
- Kenyan data requires Kenyan context
- Nairobi is not Kansasâ€”geopolitical realities differ
- Our ethics are non-negotiable, not optional features

### For Whom?

- **Kenyan Journalists** investigating public accountability
- **East African Researchers** studying digital ecosystems
- **Local NGOs** monitoring human rights
- **Ethical Developers** building decolonial tools

### Principles Over Profit

We measure success not in data points collected, but in:
- Community capacity built
- Ethical boundaries respected
- Kenyan digital sovereignty advanced
